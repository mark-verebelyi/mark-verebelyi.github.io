## Introduction
I am a leader in engineering, guiding 20 engineers across 2 distributed, remote-first teams. I'm managing one of the teams directly, while I provide leadership to the other team through their engineering manager. With over 3 years of experience in engineering management, I focus on creating high-performing, collaborative teams that deliver impactful results. My leadership experience is backed by more than 15 years as a software engineer, where I specialized in backend technologies, particularly in highly available, fault tolerant distributed systems. Today, my primary interests lie in mentoring, coaching, career development, and driving technical vision and strategy.

## Leadership Philosophy
I believe in fostering an environment of mutual respect, open communication, and transparency. I strive to build teams where everyone, regardless of seniority, feels empowered to speak up, contribute ideas, and collaborate on solving problems. By promoting a feedback culture, I ensure that both giving and receiving constructive input are part of our everyday work.

I'm passionate about helping people grow in their careers. Through coaching and mentoring, I support team members in their professional development, guiding them to reach their full potential and succeed in their roles.

My approach to engineering is driven by long-term thinking and sustainability. I focus on delivering high-quality, future-proof solutions that address both current and future needs, without getting lost in the pursuit of perfection. I prioritize clear, accessible communication with non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that engineering priorities align with broader business goals. Together, we work towards "good enough" solutions that meet our objectives efficiently while keeping a strategic vision in sight.

   In this series of articles, I share the journey my team and I went through in tackling the challenges of managing technical debt and developing a long-term, sustainable technical vision. I explain how we introduced monthly technical forums, which led to a more organized and visible structure for managing our technical priorities. This new approach improved communication with non-technical stakeholders and, ultimately, allowed us to include more technical items in our product roadmap.
