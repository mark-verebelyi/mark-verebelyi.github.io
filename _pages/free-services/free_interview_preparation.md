Hi, I’m Mark. 

For the past decade, I’ve been conducting technical interviews, primarily focused on software engineering roles. I've had the privilege of hiring and working with many talented engineers. Over the years, I’ve refined my interview approach and developed a strong sense of what makes a candidate stand out. I want to help software engineers gain confidence, make an impact, and succeed.

# What I Offer
I’m offering free interview preparation for IT professionals, particularly software engineers. Here are a few areas, I can help with:

* Insights into what hiring managers seek
* General advice to improve interview skills for software engineering roles
* Tailored guidance based on your experience and target roles
* Communication skill-building
* Mock interviews with real-time feedback

# About Me
Having firsthand experience as both an interviewer and a candidate, I can provide practical advice on technical skills, interview strategies, and career development to help you excel in your software engineering journey.

* I conducted numerous interviews across multiple teams, so I understand the process from the interviewer's point of view. I am familiar with the specific criteria that companies look for in candidates.
* I have extensive experience as a software engineer and as an engineering leader, which give me a deep understanding of the technical skills and knowledge required for success in the field.
* I have mentored and coached team members and leaders, helping them to develop their skills and advance their careers.
