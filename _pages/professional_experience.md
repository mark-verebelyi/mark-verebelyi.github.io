## Senior Engineering Manager | Brandwatch
Copenhagen, Denmark  
Nov 2022 - Present (2 yrs)

I lead two software engineering teams: the first, consisting of 12 engineers organized into two sub-teams, which I manage directly; and the second, with 5 engineers, where I provide leadership through their engineering manager, who reports directly to me.

  - I collaborated with the product manager to gain insights into the team’s progress and challenges.

- **Driving Objectives and Progress:**
  - Setting clear objectives and ensuring progress, even without direct presence, became crucial.
  - I developed the skill to navigate challenges with limited information.

- **Scaling Company Initiatives:**
  - Leading company-wide initiatives across multiple teams required coordination and alignment to ensure consistent outcomes.
